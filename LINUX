MAKING A DIRECTORY:

mkdir ~/search_replace_project
cd ~/search_replace_project

MAKING A DIRECTORY SAMPLE TEXTS:

mkdir sample_texts
cd sample_texts

CREATING FILES WHERE REPLACEMENT WILL TAKE PLACE:

echo "This is a test file containing the word Linux." > file1.txt
echo "Another file with Linux and other words." > file2.txt
echo "More content about Linux in this file." > file3.txt

WRITING THE SCRIPT HERE, THAT WILL PERFORM THE REPLACEMENT:

cd ~/search_replace_project
nano search_replace.sh

THE CODE OF THE SCRIPT:

#!/bin/bash
# Script to search and replace words in text files

echo "Enter the word to search for:"
read search_term

echo "Enter the word to replace it with:"
read replacement_term

echo "Enter the directory path containing the files:"
read directory_path

if [ ! -d "$directory_path" ]; then
    echo "Directory does not exist. Please check the path and try again."
    exit 1
fi

matching_files=$(grep -rl "$search_term" "$directory_path")

if [ -z "$matching_files" ]; then
    echo "No files contain the word '$search_term'."
    exit 0
else
    echo "Files containing '$search_term':"
    echo "$matching_files"
fi

echo "Do you want to replace '$search_term' with '$replacement_term' in the above files? (y/n)"
read confirmation
if [ "$confirmation" != "y" ]; then
    echo "Replacement canceled."
    exit 0
fi

for file in $matching_files; do
    sed -i.bak "s/$search_term/$replacement_term/g" "$file"
    echo "Replaced in $file"
done

echo "$(date): Replaced '$search_term' with '$replacement_term' in files:" >> replacement_log.txt
echo "$matching_files" >> replacement_log.txt
echo "Changes logged in replacement_log.txt"

GIVING PERMISSIONS TO IT:

chmod +x search_replace.sh

EXECUTION OF THE PROJECT:

./search_replace.sh
Enter the directory path (e.g., ~/search_replace_project/sample_texts)
